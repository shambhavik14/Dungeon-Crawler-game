# PROJECT 5 Graphical Adventure Game

## Overview
### This project is a dungeon game where a dungeon consists of number of caves and tunnels are interconnected to each other. The user gives the height, width, interconnectivity, wrapping or non wrapping, percentage of caves for treasure and difficulty level information of the dungeon. A tunnel has only 2 exits. A start and end cave is randomly generated and the player starts at the starting location, moves from one location to another and checks for directions to move. Player collects treasure and arrow on the way to reach the destination. The dungeon has monsters in caves. Player is supposed to shoot these monsters. A player smells something when there is a monster nearby. If the player shoots otyugh he is free to move otherwise the monster kills the player. The project used mvc model architecture.

## Design changes
### Gave an option to the player to collect the treasure.
### Created dungeon with random left over edges.

## Assumptions
### 1. Since there is only one player in the game, the count of treasure collected is stored in the game.
### 2. If player has only moved, the status of moving is not displayed as it is visible to the user.

## Limitations
### 1. BFS can increase time and space complexity.
